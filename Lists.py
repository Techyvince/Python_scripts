# a list is a structure we can use inside of python to store list of information.
# We can take different data values, put them into a list, keep track of them and organize them a lot easier 
# we use open and close sqaure bracket[]
# we can store multiple values into the same variable or object

print(friends)
#print(class1[1:])
